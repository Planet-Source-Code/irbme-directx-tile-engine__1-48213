### Description

This is a little tile engine I made a few months back. It includes a map editor, the engine itself and a built in little example. The engine supports things like fadein/fadeout, collision detection, scrolling maps of unlimited size, ''Tile portals'' (Tiles which when stepped on lead to other tiles/maps. For example - try going inside the caves for a pleasant surprise). Be sure to read the readme file and if you plan on using the editor, read the help file. Comments/Suggestions welcome.
